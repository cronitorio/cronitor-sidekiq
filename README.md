# Sidekiq Cronitor

![Tests](https://github.com/cronitorio/cronitor-sidekiq/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

[Cronitor](https://cronitor.io/) provides dead simple monitoring for cron jobs, daemons, queue workers, websites, APIs, and anything else that can send or receive an HTTP request. The Cronitor Sidekiq library provides a drop in integration for monitoring any Sidekiq Job.

## Installation

Add sidekiq-cronitor your application's Gemfile, near sidekiq:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq'
gem 'sidekiq-cronitor'
```

And then bundle:

```sh
bundle
```

## Usage

Configure `sidekiq-cronitor` with an [API Key](https://cronitor.io/docs/api) from [your settings](https://cronitor.io/settings). You can use ENV variables to configure Cronitor:

```sh
export CRONITOR_API_KEY='api_key_123'
export CRONITOR_ENVIRONMENT='development' #default: 'production'

bundle exec sidekiq
```

Or declare the API key directly on the Cronitor module from within your application (e.g. the Sidekiq initializer).

```ruby
require 'cronitor'
Cronitor.api_key = 'api_key_123'
Cronitor.environment = 'development' #default: 'production'
```

Monitor jobs by registering `Sidekiq::Cronitor::ServerMiddleware` server [middleware](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/mperham/sidekiq/Sidekiq/Middleware) (most people do this in the Sidekiq initializer).

```ruby
Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.server_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add Sidekiq::Cronitor::ServerMiddleware
  end
end
```

Once the server middleware is registered, Cronitor will send [telemetry events](https://cronitor.io/docs/teleme) with a `key` matching the name of your job class (`MyJob` in the example below). If no monitor exists it will create one on the first event. You can configure rules at a later time via the Cronitor dashboard, API, or [YAML config](https://github.com/cronitorio/cronitor-ruby#configuring-monitors) file.

Optional: You can specify the monitor key directly using `sidekiq_options`:

```ruby
class MyJob
  include Sidekiq::Job
  sidekiq_options cronitor_key: 'abc123'

  def perform
  end
end
```

### Enable/Disable

To disable Cronitor for a specific job you can set the following option:

```ruby
class MyJob
  include Sidekiq::Job
  sidekiq_options cronitor_disabled: true

  def perform
  end
end
```

To disable Cronitor for all jobs, and selectively enable it, you can set the following option:

```sh
export CRONITOR_AUTO_DISCOVER_SIDEKIQ='false'
```

or

```ruby
require 'cronitor'
Cronitor.auto_discover_sidekiq = false
```

then enable the jobs you want to report to Cronitor:

```ruby
class MyJob
  include Sidekiq::Job
  sidekiq_options cronitor_enabled: true

  def perform
  end
end
```

## Periodic/Scheduled Jobs

If you are using Sidekiq Enterprise to run [Periodic Jobs](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Periodic-Jobs) or are using the popular [sidekiq-scheduler](https://github.com/moove-it/sidekiq-scheduler) gem, you can sync the schedules of those jobs with a single command.

```ruby
Sidekiq::Cronitor::PeriodicJobs.sync_schedule!
# or
Sidekiq::Cronitor::SidekiqScheduler.sync_schedule!
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
